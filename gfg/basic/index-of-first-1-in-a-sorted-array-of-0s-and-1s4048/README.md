![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a sorted array  **arr**  consisting of  **0** s and  **1** s. The task is to find the index (0-based indexing) of the first  **1**  in the given array.

 **NOTE:** If one is not present then, return -1.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input : arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Output : 6
Explanation: The index of first 1 in the array is 6.

```

```
Input : arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 0]
Output : -1
Explanation: 1's are not present in the array.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1

class Solution {
    public int firstIndex(int arr[]) {
        int i=0;
        while(i<arr.length){
            if(arr[i]==1){
                return i;
            }
            i++;
            
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
