## Problem

### Coin Flip

A coin has $1$ printed on one side and $2$ on the other. Each flip adds the number on the face-up side to a running sum, initially $0$.

Find the number of distinct sequences of flips whose sum is exactly $S$. Two sequences are different if they differ in length or in the result of at least one flip. For example, $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$ are different sequences.

### Input Format

The input contains a single integer $S$, the required sum.

### Output Format

Print the number of distinct sequences of flips whose sum is exactly $S$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le S \le 20$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
```

```
3
```

### Explanation:

To achieve a sum of 3, there are three ways:

- (1, 2)
- (2, 1)
- (1, 1, 1)
### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
2
```

```
2
```

### Explanation:

To achieve a sum of 2, there are two ways:

- (1, 1)
- (2)
